## For conda:

                | grep -o '"Anaconda3-[^"]*-Linux-x86_64.sh"' \
                | tr -d '"' \
                | sort -V \
                | tail -n 1)
curl -o ~/.temp/anaconda_install.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/$VERSION
chmod +x ~/.temp/anaconda_install.sh
~/.temp/anaconda_install.sh
```

```bash
eval "$(/home/user/anaconda3/bin/conda shell.fish hook)"
conda init fish
```

## For mounting separate drive permanently in FS
**Make sure that the OS/file system is fully shut down prior to beginning. will not allow to mount the system unless the read-only lock has been released during full shutdown**
```bash
lsblk
lsblk -f
```
Find the name of the drive to mount, as well as copying the UUID. Next create mount point folder, likely in the `/mnt` directory
```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/your_desired_name
```
Manually mount, then include in `/etc/fstab` for automatic mounting on startup (specifically mount a partition.)
```bash
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1p3 /mnt/WINDOWS
```
```bash
echo"
UUID=UUID_OF_PAE
"
```



## Wireguard

```bash
sudo pacman -S wireguard-tools openresolv
```
```
sudo cp wireguard_config_file.conf /etc/wireguard/NAME.conf
```

Enable IP forwarding:
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/30-wireguard.conf
sudo sysctl --system
```
Open necessary ports, enable systemd-resolved
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=51820/udp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=wireguard --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved
```

Now just start the vpn connection (`.conf` not needed in name of config being activated):
```bash
sudo wg-quick up NAME
```
